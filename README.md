## Getting started

1. Install Python (preferably using anaconda)
2. Install python packages 
   
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. (Optional, Windows only) [Install NEURON with an installer](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download)
4. Run notebook

    `jupyter lab notebook.ipynb`
    or
    `jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`

## About

This model uses the NEURON simulation environment

HOC template for PV model is found in `src/cells/PV_template.hoc`

Morphology and mechanisms found under `src/cells/morphologies` and `src/cells/mechanisms`

The model was optimised using BluePyOpt:

doi: 10.3389/fninf.2016.00017

The axon and sodium channels were adjusted for the paper: Developmentally-regulated impairment of parvalbumin interneuron synaptic transmission in an experimental model of Dravet syndrome
